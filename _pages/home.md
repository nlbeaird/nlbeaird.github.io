**I'm a physical oceanographer interested in making novel observations to better understand high latitude processes.**

During postdocs at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (with Fiamma Straneo) and Oregon State University (with Emily Shroyer), I've researched the interactions between the North Atlantic ocean and the Greenland ice sheet, and explored the role of turbulence in Alaska's Chukchi Sea.

My Ph.D. thesis at the University of Washington (with Peter Rhines and Charlie Eriksen) focused on using autonomous vehicles to measure the overflow of dense water from the Nordic Seas into the subpolar North Atlantic.
